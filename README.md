# Secure-Login-System
✅ Problem Statement:
In today’s digital world, ensuring secure access to systems is critical. Many traditional login systems rely solely on usernames and passwords, which can be easily compromised. To enhance security, this project aims to build a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) system using Python, where users must verify their identity through a combination of:

Username

Password

Mobile number

One-Time Password (OTP)

This project addresses the need for an extra layer of security in authentication processes, especially in scenarios where sensitive information or access control is important. The goal is to simulate a secure login process in a command-line environment, making it easy to understand, extend, and apply in real-world use cases.
